# **Library Management System**  

## **Overview**  
The Library Management System is a backend API built with Python to manage library operations efficiently. It allows admins to handle users, books, and borrow requests, while users can view available books, make borrowing requests, and check their history. The system ensures secure access and prevents overlapping book borrow requests.

## **Features**  
### **Admin (Librarian):**  
- Create and manage library users.  
- Approve or deny book borrow requests.  
- View a userâ€™s borrowing history.  

### **Library Users:**  
- Browse and view available books.  
- Submit book borrow requests with specific dates.  
- Check their personal borrowing history.  

### **System Highlights:**  
- Prevents double-booking of the same book during overlapping periods.  
- Implements secure authentication for all API endpoints.  
- Handles edge cases such as invalid data or non-existent users/books.
